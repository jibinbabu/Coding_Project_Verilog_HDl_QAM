# Coding_Project_Verilog_HDl_QAM

QAM is used in many applications like color television, Wi-Max, OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), and in digital satellite communication system. The 4-QAM is thus designed and implemented on the De2i 150 board using the Quartus II software for the transmitter and the receiver. The signal is transmitted from transmitter to the receiver using De2i 150 boards, an ADC and a DAC board. The constellation visualization of the 4-QAM and 8-QAM is also obtained on the display along with the received waveform.
